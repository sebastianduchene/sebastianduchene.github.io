Our recent paper, _Assessing the effect of model specification and prior sensitivity on Bayesian tests of temporal signal_ ([Tay et al. 2024][manuscript-link]), has been recently accepted! We have updated the latest version in [PLoS Computational Biology][manuscript-link]. My PhD student, [John Tay][john-site] and I led this work in collaboration with [Arthur Kocher][arthur-site]. 

In this post, I will summarise the key findings, explain the implications for future studies, and suggest strategies to improve the assessment of temporal signal.

## Motivation
Temporal signal refers to the situation where the window of time over which sequences data have been collected is enough to calculate the evolutionary rate. In the presence of a perfect molecular clock wee expect molecular substitutions to accumulate roughly linearly over time, such that samples collected more recently have more substitutions than those collected earlier. Temporal signal is typically inspected using a root-to-tip regression (Fig 1).

This study built on previous work where we developed [BETS, Bayesian Evaluation of Temporal Signal (Duchene et al. 2020)][bets-paper] ([click here for a tutorial][bets-tutorial]). The goal of BETS is to determine whether incorporating sampling times improves that statistical fit of the full Bayesian phylogenetic model. Sampling times are a valuable source of information for calibrating the molecular clock, and thus understanding whether they can be reliably used is of great interest, particularly for recently evolving outbreaks or analyses involving ancient DNA.

The current study was motivated by our observations that the prior in Bayesian phylogenetics can impact model selection using Bayes factors and marginal likelihoods, even when it does not impact the posterior ([Tay et al. 2023][episodic-paper]). BETS treats the question of temporal signal as a model selection problem, and it uses Bayes factors and marginal likelihoods, such we thought it was important to assess its sensitivity to the choice of the prior.
