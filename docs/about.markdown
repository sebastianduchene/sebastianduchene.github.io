I am a group leader at [Institut Pasteur](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/member/sebastian-duchene-garzon/), Paris, France (since October 2023), and I have a split appointment at the [Doherty Institute](https://www.doherty.edu.au/people/dr-sebastian-duchene) in the University of Melbourne. Prior to coming to France I spent most of my time in Australia. I was awarded my PhD at the University of Sydney in 2015, with an award from the Faculty of Science and from the Genetics Society of Australasia. I also hold the title of Accredited Statistician from the Australian Statistical Society. After my PhD I conducted postdoctoral work at the same institution for 18 months. In 2016 I joined the University of Melbourne through an internal fellowship scheme, the McKenzie fellowship, and have been consistently funded by extramural sources. From 2019 to 2022 I was a Discovery Early Career Fellow (DECRA - Australian Research Council). From 2022 I was junior group leader (equivalent to Assistant Professor) funded through a Future Fellowship from the Australian Research Council and a National Health and Medical Research Council Emerging leader Level 2.

I have supervised four postdoctoral researchers through my own funding, three PhD students to completion, four Masters in bioinformatics, and one in honours. My research outputs have resulted in over [10K citations and a H-index of 46](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=K7q8WywAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

My research has been in the field of microbial computational molecular evolution, with the following major contributions:
